# Rock SOLID
### As a project team, we promise to:
 * Respect each other's ideas and work.
 * Communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.
 * Create a SOLID design that encapsulates all of the material and knowledge that we have gained throughout the course of the semester
* Learn from each other and present new techniques and approaches to each other that have worked for us in the past
* Delegate tasks fairly and appropriately
* Manage the workflow of the project and adhere to the timeline


### If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
 * Have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement.
 * Report the issue in the Team Sprint Report.
 * If further infractions occur, the course staff will be reached out to

### Team Procedures:
 * Our team will maintain correspondence throughout the duration of the entire project, which includes daily standups and progress updates. We will also schedule meetings on Monday nights where we discuss our code in more detail and make sure our overall structure and design is in accordance with the goals we set. 
 * Our team will communicate through a text group chat, but we will conduct our daily standups using Zoom. In terms of programming, we will try to do as much pair programming as possible, and this will likely occur in person. 
* The majority of team decisions throughout the duration of the project will be made by majority-vote, albeit in the case of vital issues that are decided on by consensus
 * We will set agendas at the beginning of each sprint (likely on Mondays). We will choose agenda items based on a roundtable discussion involving each team memberâ€™s input, but we will then open up the meeting to a  broader discussion on prioritizing tasks.
