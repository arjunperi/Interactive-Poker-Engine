##DESIGN PLAN

__Introduction__

Our team is planning to create an application that allows the user to play the game of poker.
Several variations of poker will be playable, including Texas Hold 'em
and Omaha. The program will be split into engine, player, and data APIs that work together
to run the game. While the user will be able to choose from several preset variations, the
program will support modifications to many aspects of gameplay, such as number of cards each player is dealt,
the number of community cards, the types of cards used, hand ranks, visibility of cards.
