- Talk about our goal for now: we're doing poker with these three archetypes, each of them supporting a number of different variations
    - explain what the three types are and how they vary 
- Talk about right now, each achetype will allow for different variations like number of cards dealt per turn, number of turns etc.
    - but in the future, we hope to be able to mess around with deck sizes and card types
- Right now, we're working on the backend, trying to explore how we can create the most flexible APIs and hierarachies to support 
different versions of poker gameflow
    - Next, we will integrate the backend with the frontend
    - Last sprint will be optional features like deck / hand customization and better GUI 
- Demo current wireframe / GUI plan
- Demo the code

- Talk about the plan:
