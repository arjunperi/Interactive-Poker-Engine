#### Interesting Notes

##### Learning JavaFX
This week showed a steep learning curve as I had to learn a completely new aspect of programming with graphics. Learning JavaFX was certainly a novel coding experience for me, due to both the nature of coding graphical programs as well as the structure that is involved. For example, it was very tough at first to overcome the fact that the entire code is being run as a series of infinite loops, and that the rest of the program needed to be strucutured as methods that are repeatedly called. After some practice, and by referring to the example code, I was able to nail down how JavaFX works as a whole. 

##### Team Dynamic
One of the biggest uncertaities that came with this past week was the experience of working with a random partner and not knowing how our dynamic would play out. After meeting my partner, we had a good initial discussion about the Plan.md document and how we were going to approach the project. Overall, I think I am surprised as to how well we work together. Our working styles are pretty similar -  we don't feel the need to meet very frequently and instead we trust the quality of eachother's work and rely on text updates when one of us makes changes. So far, I am definitely happy with how the dynamic is working so far, but time will tell how our mutual style plays out once the project specifcations ramp up. 

#### Summaries

##### Git Workflow
One of the most important things I learned through the various readings was how to work in teams with Git. Initially, I asuumed that using Git with other people would not be any different than using git alone - once someone makes a change, they push it, and when someone else wants to get those changes, they pull it. However, I had not considered the issue of merge conflicts, and through the readings as well as practice in the lab, I was able to see how using branches to keep local work and merge requests are key to maintaining clean code records. Over the course of the project thus far, the git workflow has become more natural, though dealing with merge conflicts is something that I still need more practice with. 


##### Principles
Another important takeaway from this week was the lessons on principles, specifically the single responsiblity and open closed principles. After these readings, I was able to go into my code and realize the level of refactoring that was needed. For example, after learning about the open closed principle, I replaced a series of if statements and other convoluted logic with new classes that applied abstraction by extending classes. This made my code so much more readable, and even more helpful, it made adding new features much easiser. 

#### Reflection

##### What was difficult about your work this week and why?
Learning JavaFX quickly and applying it to my own project was definitely the most difficult aspect of this workweek because it was an extremely steep learning curve over a short period of time. Additionally, the uncertainty of partner dynamic was a bit difficult to deal with and slightly anxiety-inducing, but as soon as I met my partner this was put at ease. 

##### What were the most important things you learned?
The most important things I learned were the importance of certain coding principles such as the open closed principles as these were more advanced practices that I was not accustomed to and they will affect how I design code from here on out. Also, the newfound ability to use Git in teams will be extremely helpful moving forward. 

##### How will this learning change your work next week?
As previously mentioned, I will now be able to design code using abstraction and extension, and I will also be much more accustomed to working with both JavaFX and team Git workflow.
